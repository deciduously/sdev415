The first line of the greetme script is called a hashbang, so-called because it
consists of a hash "#" followed by a bang "!".  When the file has the executable
flag set, bash will use the path specified here to look for an interpreter to
run the code.  In this manner you can direct bash to run any suitable
interpreter implicitly simply by executing the file via bash.  Commonly seen
languages used this way include "sh", "bash", "sed", "awk", "perl", and "python".
Most of these will be located in "/usr/bin".
